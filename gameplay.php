					<h1>How Many Pyramids can you BASH!?</h1>
					
					<ul>
						
						<li><h2>Try bashing as many pyramids off the screen as you can.</h2></li>
						
						<li><h2>In order to knock a pyramid off the screen, the defender at the center of the screen
							    must be the same color as the pyramid it attacks. &nbsp;  Otherwise, it will simply switch colors with
							    the pyramid it attacks.
						</h2></li>
						
						<li><h2>Use the directional buttons to change the defender's direction and have it jump cells.  However, it
							    cannot move past the center 4 squares. &nbsp; Press the space bar to launch an attack.
							
					    </h2></li>
						
						<li><h2>Levels increase for every 10 pyramids you knock off the screen. &nbsp; Just be ready to move faster
								as you level up.  The game isn't over until the pyramids make it to the center squares.
						</h2></li>
						
						<li><h2>Submit a high score after the game is over.  User-names have to be at least 2 characters long and please,
							    don't use any wingdings for your user-name (*,&,^,%,&,@, etc.).  Otherwise, they won't be entered. 
							    Good Luck and enjoy!!</h2></li>
